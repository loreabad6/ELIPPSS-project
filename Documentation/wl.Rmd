## Introduction 

The water level station objective was to track changes of the water level of the river Aa on the site of renaturation. The station was equipped with two Ultrasonic Distance sensors, in case of failure of one of them. The data was recorded on an SD card while on the field every ten seconds, including a timestamp for each log. 

The construction of the logger required the use of the basic sensors available in the senseBox, the senseBox shield which includes a microSD socket and a Real-Time-Clock, as well as a container to place the built logger in, and to place it on the study area in an isolated manner. Figure 1 shows the logger built and placed on the study area.

Water level on rivers are an important variable to analyze given a renaturation process, as the renaturation itself serves as a flood control technique, due to the flux reduction the curvature of the natural river creates (Disse & Engel, 2001). 

## Materials

To build this logger, as well as the other loggers for the current project, we made use of the [senseBox:edu toolkit](https://sensebox.de/en/products). For this project, we used the previous senseBox version, therefore, the documentation on the site might have changed, but is still supported. The senseBox used is based on an [Arduino Genuino Uno board](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/BoardAnatomy), on which, an user-friendly and easy-to-learn programming language can be used to configure the logger. The code used for this particular logger can be found on the section [Arduino code].

The materials to build the logger are listed below:

* senseBox:edu box items:
    * Arduino Genuino Uno board
    * [senseBox shield](https://learn.watterott.com/sensebox/shield/)
    * 2 [HC-SR04](http://biblioteca.geekfactory.mx/Sensor_HC-SR04/DS_HC-SR04.pdf) Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
    * Breadboard
    * Jumper wires
    * Resistors
    * USB cable
    * AA battery holder
* 6 AA batteries
* microSD card
* Battery CR2032

Two distance sensors were used, in case of failure of one. The container was isolated with sylicon to avoid water contact with the inner connections, in case of rain. 

## Wiring 

The following figure illustrates the wiring of the logger. The illustration was made with the [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) software. 

**NOTE:** The board used to connect the sensors was the senseBox shield, however, its illustration was not available on Fritzing. The microSD socket and the RV-8523 RTC (I2C Real-Time-Clock) are built onto that shield, and therefore do not appear on the figure.

## Arduino code

**NOTE:** The timestamp is recorded by the Real-Time-Clock on the senseBox shield. The time has to be configured only one time when loading the code, and the time can be changed on the setup section of the code, now commented.

## Example of output

This is an example of the output data logged with the code loaded to the logger. There are two columns, left and right sensor, which correspond both to the Ultrasonic Distance sensors. The purpose of using two, was to have a backup in case one of them stops recording. Also a power cut on the logger may resert the clock recording the timestamp. Therefore, cleaning the data and averaging both values collected by the sensors is recommended.

```{r example, echo=FALSE}
head(read.csv("E:/GeoTech/2nd/5. UAS/5. Documentation/WaterLevel/WL.csv"))
```
